# HW4

## Assignment1
### 
- GENERATE  100 samples of different sizes N (N>10 & N<2000) from each of 5 different distributions (500 samples in total), _all with the same population mean_
- Include a _Normal_, a _Poisson_, a _Binomial_, a _Chi-Squared_, and a_Geometric_ distribution.   
- For each sample PLOT the sample mean (dependent var.) against the sample size N (independent var.) 
- DESCRIBE the behavior I see in the plots in terms of the _law of large numbers_ or _Central Limit Theorem_.
- PLOT the distributions of all sample means (together for all distributions).
