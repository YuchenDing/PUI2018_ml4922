a. Null and alternative hypothesis are formulated correctly

b. The data supports the project which means the data has the appropriate features to answer the question and the data was properly pre-processed to extract the needed values. All genders were extracted although we just need to compare the unknown gender for customers and subscribers.

c. In this hypothesis test, we want to test the proportion of customers with unknown gender is the same or less than the proportion  of subscribers with unknown gender. As we use the proportion, the dependent variable is continuous. Since customer and subscriber are categorical variables, and our controlled variable, gender, is also a categorical variable, I will choose ANCOVA to to test H0.
